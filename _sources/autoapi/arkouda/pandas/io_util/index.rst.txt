arkouda.pandas.io_util
======================

.. py:module:: arkouda.pandas.io_util

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   File and directory utility functions for Arkouda's pandas module.

   This module provides a set of helper functions for performing common I/O operations
   needed during data processing, configuration, and metadata management. It includes
   utilities for creating and deleting directories, reading and writing key-value pairs
   from/to delimited text files, and appending lines to files.

   Exports
   -------
   __all__ = [
       "delete_directory",
       "delimited_file_to_dict",
       "dict_to_delimited_file",
       "get_directory",
       "write_line_to_file",
   ]

   Functions
   ---------
   get_directory(path: str) -> Path
       Create a directory if it doesn't exist and return its `Path` object.

   write_line_to_file(path: str, line: str) -> None
       Append a single line to a file, creating it if necessary.

   delimited_file_to_dict(path: str, delimiter: str = ",") -> Dict[str, str]
       Load key-value pairs from a delimited file into a dictionary.

   dict_to_delimited_file(path: str, values: Mapping[Any, Any], delimiter: str = ",") -> None
       Write a dictionary to a file as delimited key-value lines.

   delete_directory(dir: str) -> None
       Recursively delete a directory if it exists.

   .. rubric:: Notes

   - `dict_to_delimited_file` currently only supports a comma (`,`) as a delimiter.
   - Errors encountered during I/O are either printed or raised, depending on context.
   - This module is intended for internal use within Arkouda's pandas compatibility layer.

   .. rubric:: Examples

   >>> from arkouda.io_util import get_directory, write_line_to_file
   >>> path = get_directory("tmp/output")
   >>> write_line_to_file(path / "log.txt", "Computation completed")

Module Contents
---------------

.. py:function:: delete_directory(dir: str) -> None

   Delete the directory if it exists.

   :param dir: The path to the directory
   :type dir: str

   :raises OSError: Raised if there's an error in deleting the directory.


.. py:function:: delimited_file_to_dict(path: str, delimiter: str = ',') -> Dict[str, str]

   Return a dictionary populated by lines from a file.

   Return a dictionary populated by lines from a file where
   the first delimited element of each line is the key and
   the second delimited element is the value.
   If the file does not exist, return an empty dictionary.

   :param path: Path to the file
   :type path: str
   :param delimiter: Delimiter separating key and value
   :type delimiter: str

   :returns: Dictionary containing key,value pairs derived from each
             line of delimited strings
   :rtype: Mapping[str,str]

   :raises UnsupportedOperation: Raised if there's an error in reading the file
   :raises ValueError: Raised if a line has more or fewer than two delimited elements


.. py:function:: dict_to_delimited_file(path: str, values: Mapping[Any, Any], delimiter: str = ',') -> None

   Write a dictionary to delimited lines in a file.

   Write a dictionary to delimited lines in a file where
   the first delimited element of each line is the dict key
   and the second delimited element is the dict value. If the
   file does not exist, it is created and then written to.

   :param path: Path to the file
   :type path: str
   :param delimiter: Delimiter separating key and value

   :raises OError: Raised if there's an error opening or writing to the
       specified file
   :raises ValueError: Raised if the delimiter is not supported


.. py:function:: get_directory(path: str) -> pathlib.Path

   Create the directory if it does not exist and returns the corresponding Path object.

   :param path: The path to the directory
   :type path: str

   :returns: Object corresponding to the directory
   :rtype: Path

   :raises ValueError: Raised if there's an error in reading an
       existing directory or creating a new one


.. py:function:: write_line_to_file(path: str, line: str) -> None

   Write a line to the requested file.

   Note: if the file
   does not exist, the file is created first and then
   the specified line is written to it.

   :param path: Path to the target file
   :type path: str
   :param line: Line to be written to the file
   :type line: str

   :raises UnsupportedOption: Raised if there's an error in creating or
       writing to the file
