   Number of cache pages that were prefetched but did not arrive in the cache before being accessed
   (i.e., the prefetches were too late).

   :rtype: pdarray


.. py:function:: get_comm_diagnostics_cache_put_misses()

   Return number of puts that required the cache to create a new page to store them.

   :returns: A pdarray, where the size is the number of locales,
             populated with the statistic value from each locale.
   :rtype: pdarray


.. py:function:: get_comm_diagnostics_cache_readahead_unused()

   Return number of cache pages that were read ahead but unused.

   The number of cache pages that were read ahead but evicted from the cache before being accessed
   (i.e., the readaheads were too early).

   :returns: A pdarray, where the size is the number of locales,
             populated with the statistic value from each locale.
   :rtype: pdarray


.. py:function:: get_comm_diagnostics_cache_readahead_waited()

   Return number of cache pages that were read ahead but waited.

   Return number of cache pages that were read ahead
   but did not arrive in the cache before being accessed
   (i.e., the readaheads were too late).
