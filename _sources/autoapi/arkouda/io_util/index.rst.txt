.. function:: get_directory(path: str) -> pathlib.Path

   Creates the directory if it does not exist and then
   returns the corresponding Path object

   :param path: The path to the directory
   :type path: str

   :returns: Path object corresponding to the directory
   :rtype: str

   :raises ValueError: Raised if there's an error in reading an
       existing directory or creating a new one


.. function:: write_line_to_file(path: str, line: str) -> None

   Writes a line to the requested file. Note: if the file
   does not exist, the file is created first and then
   the specified line is written to it.

   :param path: Path to the target file
   :type path: str
   :param line: Line to be written to the file
   :type line: str

   :returns:
   :rtype: None

   :raises UnsupportedOption: Raised if there's an error in creating or
       writing to the file


.. function:: delimited_file_to_dict(path: str, delimiter: str = ',') -> Dict[(str, str)]

   Returns a dictionary populated by lines from a file where
   the first delimited element of each line is the key and
   the second delimited element is the value.

   :param path: Path to the file
   :type path: str
   :param delimiter: Delimiter separating key and value
   :type delimiter: str

   :returns: Dictionary containing key,value pairs derived from each
             line of delimited strings
   :rtype: Mapping[str,str]

   :raises UnsupportedOperation: Raised if there's an error in reading the file


.. function:: dict_to_delimited_file(path: str, values: Mapping[(Any, Any)], delimiter: str = ',') -> None

   Writes a dictionary to delimited lines in a file where
   the first delimited element of each line is the dict key
   and the second delimited element is the dict value. If the
   file does not exist, it is created and then written to.

   :param path: Path to the file
   :type path: str
   :param delimiter: Delimiter separating key and value

   :returns:
   :rtype: None

   :raises OError: Raised if there's an error opening or writing to the
       specified file
   :raises ValueError: Raised if the delimiter is not supported
