"""
When testing auto-checkpointing, we need to accommodate the unknown delays
before checkpointing starts. See directory_exists_delayed().

Another unknown delay is from when the checkpointing starts until it finishes,
especially it needs to save a noticeable amount of data. For that, we use
a testing helper that waits for an in-progres auto-checkpointing, if any,
to complete:
    ak.client.wait_for_async_activity()

`ak.load_checkpoint()` tells us whether an auto-checkpoint has been created
successfully. We do not test checkpoint correctness here. We leave that for
`checkpoint_test.py`, given that automatic and client-driven checkpoints
use the same implementation.
