# External Tools

There are several external tools that are used in our current workflow and help us optimize development.
Many of the checks that automatically run on the Arkouda Github repo CI can be run locally.
Running these prior to pushing will speed up the approval process and help ensure that all code is organized and formatted in the same way.

## PyCharm External Tools

We encourage users to configure the following third-party command-line applications as external tools to run on their local machines in PyCharm before pushing to the Arkouda Github repo. They will also automatically be run in the runtime checks.

The current applications being used are `black`, `flake8`, and `isort`.

### Using Pip

Using `pip install`, the following applications can be downloaded to your arkouda directory.

```commandline
# navigate to the arkouda directory
cd <path_to_arkouda>/arkouda

# Download each of the following applications
pip install black
pip install flake8
pip install isort
```

### Add a local external tool 

1. In a new instance of Pycharm open the Settings.

2. Navigate to the Tools section.

3. Select External Tools.

4. Select the `+` to add a new external tool.

5. Existing tools can be right clicked or doubled clicked to be edited or changed. (Optional)

6. Select `OK` to save changes.
