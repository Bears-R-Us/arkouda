Excerpt from Wikipedia:
A work of the United States government, as defined by the United States copyright law, is "a work prepared by an officer or
employee" of the federal government "as part of that person's official duties."[1] In general, under section 105 of the
Copyright Act,[2] such works are not entitled to domestic copyright protection under U.S. law and are therefore in the public
domain.

This act only applies to U.S. domestic copyright as that is the extent of U.S. federal law. The U.S. government asserts that
it can still hold the copyright to those works in other countries.[3][4]
