ArkoudaTimeCompat
=================
**Usage**

.. code-block:: chapel

   use ArkoudaTimeCompat;


or

.. code-block:: chapel

   import ArkoudaTimeCompat;

Support for routines related to measuring the passing of time.

This module provides support for querying wall time in the local
timezone and implements a record :record:`~stopwatch` that can measure
the execution time of sections of a program. The stopwatch has the
potential for microsecond resolution and is intended to be useful for
performance testing.
