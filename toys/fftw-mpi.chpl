/* This is a primer on using the MPI FFT transforms within

/* Let's start by describing the problem we plan on solving.

   We'll consider a real-to-complex 3D transform and its inverse here, and will
   stick quite closely to the C API. Other transforms will follow a similar pattern,
   and we refer the reader to the FFTW documentation for more details.

   Our steps are :
   #. Declare a 3D grid, with sizes compatible to FFTW, and fill it with random numbers.
   #. Compute the sum of squares.
   #. Forward FFT, and compute the sum of squares again, showing that the data correctly transformed.
   #. Inverse transform, and compare with the original result.

/* Notes on building.

   MPI programs are normally built with compiler wrappers; Chapel
   is usually build without these. If so, you will need to pass in the
   appropriate MPI flags to Chapel.

   With mpich, you can get these with 
   ```
   mpicc -compile_info -link_info
   ```
   or
   ```
   mpicc -show
   ```
   On my system, these convert to the following Chapel flags
   ```
   export CHPL_MPI_FLAGS="--ldflags='-Wl,-Bsymbolic-functions' --ldflags='-Wl,-z,relro' -I/usr/include/mpich -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu -lmpich"
   ```

   I assume that FFTW is in the appropriate paths.

   To compile the code :
   ```
   chpl -O --fast $CHPL_MPI_FLAGS fftw-mpi.chpl \
      -lfftw3_mpi -lfftw3_threads -lfftw3 \
      --ccflags="-Wno-incompatible-pointer-types"
   ```
   The second line just lists all the required FFT libraries, while
   the third turns off warnings about incompatible pointer types.

/* Now that we have everything initialized, we can
   start setting up the necessary arrays.

   FFTW assumes a slab-decomposition of the array, which for 3D grids
   implies that we distribute along the first dimension of the array.
   We use the Block distribution to distribute the array.

   For this example, let us assume that the grid dimension is `{Ng, Ng, Ng}`.

   FFTW suggests using the `fftw_mpi_local_size*` functions to figure
   out how much memory is necessary for FFTW. However, if `Ng` is divisible
   by the number of locales, then we don't need to do anything special, so we
   use that here.

/*
 Now construct the plan for the forward transform.

 CHPL_COMM_WORLD is a custom MPI communicator, usually just
 equal to MPI_COMM_WORLD, which attempts to ensure that rank and
 locale ids are the same.

 We also protect the FFTW MPI calls to ensure that we have completed
 all Chapel communication; this prevents deadlocks in the code. Note
 that we use the MPI module provided `Barrier` to implement a
 non-blocking barrier.

 An important subtlety here - we need to call this on every locale and the
 plan must exist on every locale. In this code, we do this by just
 doing everything in an `on` block. If we were reusing the plan, we'd
 save everything in eg. a ReplicatedVar, or a PrivateDist.
