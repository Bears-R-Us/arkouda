## Abstract:
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a prerequisite for all data
science, as illustrated by the ubiquity of Jupyter notebooks, the
preferred interface for EDA among data scientists. The operations
involved in exploring and transforming the data are often at least as
computationally intensive as downstream applications (e.g. machine
learning algorithms), and as datasets grow, so does the need for HPC-enabled
EDA. However, the inherently interactive and open-ended nature of
EDA does not mesh well with current HPC usage models. Meanwhile, several
existing projects from outside the traditional HPC space attempt to
combine interactivity and
distributed computation using programming paradigms and tools from
cloud computing, but none of these projects have come close to meeting
our needs for high-performance EDA.

To fill this gap, we have
developed a software package, called Arkouda, which allows a user to
interactively issue massively parallel computations on distributed
data using functions and syntax that mimic NumPy, the underlying
computational library used in the vast majority of Python data science
workflows. The computational heart of Arkouda is a Chapel interpreter
that
accepts a pre-defined set of commands from a client (currently
implemented in Python) and
uses Chapel's built-in machinery for multi-locale and multithreaded
execution. Arkouda has benefited greatly from Chapel's distinctive
features and has also helped guide the development of the language.

In early applications, users of Arkouda have tended to iterate rapidly
between multi-node execution with Arkouda and single-node analysis in
Python, relying on Arkouda to filter a large dataset down to a smaller
collection suitable for analysis in Python, and then feeding the results
back into Arkouda computations on the full dataset. This paradigm has
already proved very fruitful for EDA. Our goal is to enable users to
progress seamlessly from EDA to specialized algorithms by making Arkouda
an integration point for HPC implementations of expensive kernels like
FFTs, sparse linear algebra, and graph traversal. With Arkouda serving
the role of a shell, a data scientist could explore, prepare, and call
optimized HPC libraries on massive datasets, all within the same
interactive session.

Arkouda is not trying to replace Pandas but to allow for some Pandas-style 
operation at a much larger scale. In our experience Pandas can handle dataframes 
up to about 500 million rows before performance becomes a real issue, this is 
provided that you run on a sufficently capable compute server. Arkouda breaks 
the shared memory paradigm and scales its operations to dataframes with over
200 billion rows, maybe even a trillion. In practice we have run Arkouda server
operations on columns of one trillion elements running on 512 compute nodes.
This yielded a >20TB dataframe in Arkouda.

<a id="prereqs"></a>
## Prerequisites <sup><sup><sub><a href="#toc">toc</a></sub></sup></sup>

For a complete list of requirements for Arkouda, please review [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md).

For detailed prerequisite information and installation guides, please review [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

<a id="build-ak"></a>
## Building Arkouda <sup><sup><sub><a href="#toc">toc</a></sub></sup></sup>
In order to run the Arkouda server, it must first be compiled. Detailed instructions on the build process can be found at [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

<a id="test-ak"></a>
## Testing Arkouda <sup><sup><sub><a href="#toc">toc</a></sub></sup></sup>

<details>
<summary><b>(click to see more)</b></summary>

There are two unit test suites for Arkouda, one for Python and one for Chapel. As mentioned above, the Arkouda  
Python test harness leverages multiple libraries such as [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) and 
[pytest-env](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-env/) that must be installed via `pip3 install -e .[dev]`, 
whereas the Chapel test harness does not require any external librares.

The default Arkouda test executes the Python test harness and is invoked as follows:

```bash
make test
```

The Chapel unit tests can be executed as follows:

```bash
make test-chapel
```

Both the Python and Chapel unit tests are executed as follows:

```bash
make test-all
```

</details>

For more details regarding Arkouda testing, please consult the Python test [README](tests/README.md) and Chapel test
[README](test/README.md), respectively.

<a id="run-ak"></a>
## Running arkouda\_server <sup><sup><sub><a href="#toc">toc</a></sub></sup></sup>

The command-line invocation depends on whether you built a single-locale version (with `CHPL_COMM=none`) or 
multi-locale version (with `CHPL_COMM` set to the desired number of locales).

Single-locale startup:

```bash
./arkouda_server
```

Multi-locale startup (user selects the number of locales):

```bash
./arkouda_server -nl 2
```
Memory tracking is turned on by default now, you can run server with memory tracking turned off by

```bash
./arkouda_server --memTrack=false
```

By default, the server listens on port `5555`. This value can be overridden with the command-line flag 
`--ServerPort=1234`

Memory tracking is turned on by default and turned off by using the  `--memTrack=false` flag

Trace logging messages are turned on by default and turned off by using the `--trace=false` flag

Other command line options are available and can be viewed by using the `--help` flag

```bash
./arkouda-server --help
```

<a id="run-server-script"></a>
### Running the arkouda_server From a Script

With the addition of two server startup flags, `--autoShutdown` and `--serverInfoNoSplash`, running the arkouda_server from a script is easier than ever.

To connect to the server via a script, you'll first have to issue a subprocess command to start the `arkouda_server` with the optional configuration flags.

```python
import subprocess

# Update the below path to point to your arkouda_server
cmd = "/Users/<username>/Documents/git/arkouda/arkouda_server -nl 1 --serverInfoNoSplash=true --autoShutdown=true"
p = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, shell=True)
```

This will allow you to access the server output, which on launch using `--serverInfoNoSplash=true` will be a JSON string with the server configuration which can be parsed for the server host, port, and other potentially useful information.

For a full example and explanation, view the [Running From Script](training/RUNNING_FROM_SCRIPT.md) document.

<a id="run-ak-sanity"></a>
### Sanity check arkouda\_server <sup><sup><sub><a href="#toc">toc</a></sub></sup></sup>

To sanity check the arkouda server, you can run

```bash
make check
```

This will start the server, run a few computations, and shut the server down. In addition, the check script can be executed 
against a running server by running the following Python command:

```bash
python3 tests/check.py localhost 5555
```

<a id="run-ak-token-auth"></a>
### Token-Based Authentication in Arkouda <sup><sup><sub><a href="#toc">toc</a></sub></sup></sup>

Arkouda features a token-based authentication mechanism analogous to Jupyter, where a randomized alphanumeric string is
generated or loaded at arkouda\_server startup. The command to start arkouda\_server with token authentication is as follows:

```bash
./arkouda_server --authenticate
```

The generated token is saved to the tokens.txt file which is contained in the .arkouda directory located in the same 
working directory the arkouda\_server is launched from. The arkouda\_server will re-use the same token until the 
.arkouda/tokens.txt file is removed, which forces arkouda\_server to generate a new token and corresponding
tokens.txt file.

In situations where a user-specified token string is preferred, this can be specified in the ARKOUDA_SERVER_TOKEN environment variable. As is the case with an Arkouda-generated token, the user-supplied token
is saved to the .arkouda/tokens.txt file for re-use.

<a id="run-ak-connect"></a>
### Connecting to Arkouda <sup><sup><sub><a href="#toc">toc</a></sub></sup></sup>

The client connects to the arkouda\_server either by supplying a host and port or by providing a connect\_url connect string:

```bash
arkouda.connect(server='localhost', port=5555)
arkouda.connect(connect_url='tcp://localhost:5555')
```

When arkouda\_server is launched in authentication-enabled mode, clients connect by either specifying the access\_token
parameter or by adding the token to the end of the connect\_url connect string:

```bash
arkouda.connect(server='localhost', port=5555, access_token='dcxCQntDQllquOsBNjBp99Pu7r3wDJn')
arkouda.connect(connect_url='tcp://localhost:5555?token=dcxCQntDQllquOsBNjBp99Pu7r3wDJn')
```

Note: once a client has successfully connected to an authentication-enabled arkouda\_server, the token is cached in the
user's $ARKOUDA\_HOME .arkouda/tokens.txt file. As long as the arkouda_server token remains the same, the user can
connect without specifying the token via the access_token parameter or token url argument.


<a id="log-ak"></a>
## Logging <sup><sup><sub><a href="#toc">toc</a></sub></sup></sup>

The Arkouda server features a Chapel logging framework that prints out the module name, function name and line number
for all logged messages. An example is shown below:

```
2021-04-15:06:22:59 [ConcatenateMsg] concatenateMsg Line 193 DEBUG [Chapel] creating pdarray id_4 of type Int64
2021-04-15:06:22:59 [ServerConfig] overMemLimit Line 175 INFO [Chapel] memory high watermark = 44720 memory limit = 30923764531
2021-04-15:06:22:59 [MultiTypeSymbolTable] addEntry Line 127 DEBUG [Chapel] adding symbol: id_4 
```

Available logging levels are ERROR, CRITICAL, WARN, INFO, and DEBUG. The default logging level is INFO where all messages at the ERROR, CRITICAL, WARN, and INFO levels are printed. The log level can be set globally by passing in the --logLevel parameter upon arkouda\_server startup. For example, passing the --logLevel=LogLevel.DEBUG parameter as shown below sets the global log level to DEBUG:

```
./arkouda_server --logLevel=LogLevel.DEBUG
```

In addition to setting the global logging level, the logging level for individual Arkouda modules can also be configured. For example, to set MsgProcessing to DEBUG for the purposes of debugging Arkouda array creation, pass the MsgProcessing.logLevel=LogLevel.DEBUG parameter upon arkouda\_server startup as shown below:

```
./arkouda_server --MsgProcessing.logLevel=LogLevel.DEBUG --logLevel=LogLevel.WARN
```

In this example, the logging level for all other Arkouda modules will be set to the global value WARN.

<a id="typecheck-ak"></a>
## Type Checking in Arkouda <sup><sup><sub><a href="#toc">toc</a></sub></sup></sup>

Both static and runtime type checking are becoming increasingly popular in Python, especially for large Python code bases 
such as those found at [dropbox](https://dropbox.tech/application/our-journey-to-type-checking-4-million-lines-of-python). 
Arkouda uses [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for static type checking and [typeguard](https://typeguard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
for runtime type checking.

<details>
 <summary><b>(click to see more)</b></summary>

Enabling runtime as well as static type checking in Python starts with adding [type hints](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/), 
as shown below to a method signature:

```
def connect(server : str="localhost", port : int=5555, timeout : int=0, 
                           access_token : str=None, connect_url=None) -> None:
```

mypy static type checking can be invoked either directly via the mypy command or via make:

```
$ mypy arkouda
Success: no issues found in 16 source files
$ make mypy
python3 -m mypy arkouda
Success: no issues found in 16 source files
```

Runtime type checking is enabled at the Python method level by annotating the method if interest with the @typechecked decorator, an 
example of which is shown below:

```
@typechecked
def save(self, prefix_path : str, dataset : str='array', mode : str='truncate') -> str:
```

Type checking in Arkouda is implemented on an "opt-in" basis. Accordingly, Arkouda continues to support [duck typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing) for parts of the Arkouda API where type checking is too confining to be useful. As detailed above, both runtime and static 
type checking require type hints. Consequently, to opt-out of type checking, simply leave type hints out of any method declarations where duck typing is desired.

<a id="env-vars-ak"></a>
## Environment Variables <sup><sup><sub><a href="#toc">toc</a></sub></sup></sup>
The various Arkouda aspects (compilation, run-time, client, tests, etc.) can be configured using a number of environment
variables (env vars).  See the [ENVIRONMENT](ENVIRONMENT.md) documentation for more details.

<a id="versioning-ak"></a>
## Versioning <sup><sup><sub><a href="#toc">toc</a></sub></sup></sup>
Beginning after tag `v2019.12.10` versioning is now performed using [Versioneer](https://github.com/python-versioneer/python-versioneer)
which determines the version based on the location in `git`.

An example using a hypothetical tag `1.2.3.4`
```bash
git checkout 1.2.3.4
python -m arkouda |tail -n 2
>> Client Version: 1.2.3.4
>> 1.2.3.4

# If you were to make uncommitted changes and repeat the command you might see something like:
python -m arkouda|tail -n 2
>> Client Version: 1.2.3.4+0.g9dca4c8.dirty
>> 1.2.3.4+0.g9dca4c8.dirty

# If you commit those changes you would see something like
python -m arkouda|tail -n 2
>> Client Version: 1.2.3.4+1.g9dca4c8
>> 1.2.3.4+1.g9dca4c8
```
In the hypothetical cases above _Versioneer_ tells you the version and how far / how many commits beyond the tag your repo is.

When building the server-side code the same versioning information is included in the build.  If the server and client do not
match you will receive a warning.  For developers this is a useful reminder when you switch branches and forget to rebuild.

```bash
# Starting the arkouda when built from tag 1.2.3.4 shows the following in the startup banner 
arkouda server version = 1.2.3.4

# If you built from an arbitrary branch the version string is based on the derived coordinates from the "closest" tag
arkouda server version = v2019.12.10+1679.abc2f48a

# The .dirty extension denotes a build from uncommitted changes, or a "dirty branch" in git vernacular
arkouda server version = v2019.12.10+1679.abc2f48a.dirty
```

For maintainers, creating a new version is as simple as creating a tag in the repository; i.e.
```bash
git checkout master
git tag 1.2.3.4
python -m arkouda |tail -n 2
>> Client Version: 1.2.3.4
>> 1.2.3.4
git push --tags
```

<a id="external-integration"></a>
## External Systems Integration <sup><sup><sub><a href="#toc">toc</a></sub></sup></sup>

Integrating Arkouda with cloud environments enables users to access Arkouda from machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) workflows deployed to Kubernetes as an example. Detailed discussions regarding Arkouda systems integration and specific instructions for registering/deregistering Arkouda with Kubernetes are located in [EXTERNAL INTEGRATION.md](EXTERNAL_INTEGRATION.md)

<a id="metrics"></a>
## Metrics <sup><sup><sub><a href="#toc">toc</a></sub></sup></sup>

Arkouda provides a separate, dedicated zmq socket to enable generation and export of a variety of system, locale, user, and request metrics. Arkouda generated metrics in a format compatible with Prometheus, Grafana, and TimescaleDB. An Arkouda Prometheus exporter that serves as a Prometheus scrape target will be made available soon in the [arkouda-contrib](https://github.com/Bears-R-Us/arkouda-contrib) repository. A detailed discussion of Arkouda metrics is located in [METRICS.md](METRICS.md)
