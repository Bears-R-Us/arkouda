# Arkouda: NumPy-like arrays at massive scale backed by Chapel.
## _NOTE_: We have approval to open source Arkouda under the MIT license.
I would like to see several things happen before we move to an open repo:
 * better python documentation
 * better setup and run documentation
 * better dependency documentation
 * do something better with Jupyter notebooks in the current repo
 * add MIT lisence stuff
 * document contributing information
 * formulate clear process for PRs and accepting contributions
